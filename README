This is a set of plugins for various free desktop programs
which add the ability to post to imgur.com.

The src directory contains:

src/dbus/
   The back end to everything else.  This provides a DBus
   service, com.imgur, which allows upload of arbitrary
   images to the web.

src/cmd/
   A simple command-line interface to the DBus back end.

src/eog/
   An Eye of Gnome (eog) plugin.

Things which still need to be done
==================================

 * The unit and integration tests need finishing
   and integrating.

 * The DBus interface should allow access to more of
   the imgur API, such as deletion.

 * imgur now supports login (for galleries), and
   we should also support this.

 * There was a half-written Maemo libsharing service;
   this should be rescued and integrated.

 * There should be a man page for the commandline
   application.

 * There should be a corresponding imgur-like CGI
   that people can run on their own servers.

 * There should be a GUI version of the commandline
   application.

 * We should have an option to prevent uploading
   the same image twice.

 * Translations, translations, translations.

Patches are always welcomed.
